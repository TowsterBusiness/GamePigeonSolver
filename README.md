# How to run the project

I recomend using IntelliJ whne running this, please download OpenCV and a JDK to use this
This project also uses Tessteract so make sure you cause use that.
Then run this project in IntelliJ using the run command from Main.java file and your done!
Also, make sure that you have a camera on your first index of the camera list so you have something to take a picture of the game screen

First of all you should download the OpenCV library (version 3.x) from here.

Then, extract the downloaded OpenCV file in a location of your choice. Once you get the folder opencv put in wherever you prefer.

Now the only two things that you will need are: the opencv-3xx.jar file located at \opencv\build\java and the opencv_java3xx.dll library located at \opencv\build\java\x64 (for 64-bit systems) or \opencv\build\java\x86 (for 32-bit systems). 
The 3xx suffix of each file is a shortcut for the current OpenCV version, e.g., it will be 300 for OpenCV 3.0 and 330 for OpenCV 3.3.
